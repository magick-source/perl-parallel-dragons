Parallel-Dragons
================

Do you need to run some code every 2 seconds, but no more than 5 times?
Now you can - that's the basic usage of Parallel::Dragons.

Do you have a queue and need to run a block of code for each element
of the queue? That's easy - Parallel::Dragons can help you do that.

Parallel::Dragons can be used in a queue driven mode or without a queue.

In the first case it forks (some) children to run elements of the queue
and keeps fetching items from the queue and processing them.

In the second case, each children will run main() once and return - and
later a new children will be started.

ACKNOLEDGEMENT

Most of this code was written while working on booking.com projects
during booking.com time - the code was later generalized and move
to a namespace that makes (a bit) more sense.
