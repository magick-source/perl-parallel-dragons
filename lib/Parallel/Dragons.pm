=head1 NAME

Parallel::Dragons - Daemon are forever... Dragons lay eggs, grow fast
and die in flames!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use parent qw'Parallel::Dragons';

  sub max_childs { 5 } # max 5 workers at a time

  sub wait_before_restart { 10 }

  sub main {
    my $i = 0;
    while ($i++ < 100) {
        print "$$: counted to $i\n";
        sleep 1;
    }

    print "counted to 100, going away\n";
  }

  main::->new()->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parallel::Dragons is a framework to create long lived processes that run
the same code all the time, in some cases multiple times in parallel.

It doesn't know, and doesn't care about what the code does. Even when
used in queue driven mode, it doesn't care about the queue, leaving the
implementation of the queue access to the application itself.

=head1 USE

Parallel::Dragon was written to be the parent of you daemon class.

The minimal Daemon you can create implements only the sub main, which
does the job you need done. In this case max_childs will default to the
number of CPUs in your server and a new child is created every 3 seconds
until that number is reached.

The method new doesn't take any parameters, but the class handles @ARGS
to accept several command line commands and options.

Most of the time, you want to call $your_class->new()->run() and let
Parallel::Dragons take care of everything for you.

Unlike what happens with most libraries, you don't call methods in
Parallel::Dragons - Parallel::Dragons calls methods you write for it.

Parallel::Dragons was created with the idea that by defining specific
methods in your class you can change the way your Dragon behaves. We
call those methods hooks, and that's what the next section is about.

Parallel::Dragons works by having a main process that starts childs to
do all the work - the main process only stops when a small set of hooks
fails with error.

=head1 HOOKS

The hooks as listed in the order they are usually called. Some of them
are called in the main process, some of them are called in the child
process - this list tells you all you need to know.

=head2 max_childs

MAIN: Called during the init phase of the main process - it's assumed
to be a constant - see L<needs_childs> for a more dynamic hook. Your
dragon will never create more than <max_childs> at the same time.

Params: $self

=head2 wait_before_restart

MAIN: called during the init phase of the main process - it's assumed
to be a constant and represents the number of seconds that the main
process waits between starting two childs and between the end of a child
and starting a new one when the max_childs is reached.

See L<restart_next> for a more dynamic way to decide when to start
the next child.

Params: $self

=head2 restart_after

MAIN: if your Dragon uses a <queue> based model, this is the number
of time a child will ask for tasks before ending. This is called
during the init phase of the main process and is assumed to be a
constant.

Params: $self

=head2 max_memory_per_child

MAIN: this is called during the init phase of the main process and is
assumed to be a constant. It's used only in Dragons that use the
<queue> model - when a child ends executing main for a task, it checks
whether it is using more than this amount of memory and ends if it is.

Params: $self

=head2 pre_start

MAIN: called before the Dragon is started. 

Note: pre_start can prevent the Dragon from starting by calling
C<< $self->stop >>

Params: $self

=head2 need_childs

MAIN[in the loop]: it's called every time it's time to start a new
child to decide if a child needs to be created.

Params: $self

=head2 pre_fork

MAIN[in the loop]: the decision to create a new child was made, this
allow you to set any data you need to pass to the child.

Params: $self

=head2 post_child_start

MAIN[in the loop]: called in the main process imediately after a new
child is created.

Params: $self, $child

=head2 restart_next

MAIN[in the loop]: called after a child is started and is expected to
return an unix timestamp for when the next child should be started. The
child will only be started if there are less than L<max_childs> running.

Params: $self

=head2 init_child

CHILD: called when a new child is created.

Params: $self

=head2 data_consumer

CHILD: expected to return a L<Data::Consumer> compatible object. If this
method is used, the Dragon will run in <DC> mode. In this mode the method
main will be called as a (modified) consume call back. See L<main>.

Params: $self

=head2 claim_task

CHILD: expected to return a <task> that main will be able to process. If
claim_task is used, the Dragon will run in <queue> mode. In this mode main
will be called with the task return by claim_tasks.

If claim_task returns false, the child will exit - and a new one will
be created by the MAIN process when time for that comes.

Params: $self

=head2 Note on L<data_consumer> and L<claim_task>

If neither of those methods exists, main will run once for each child
and the child will end after that. We call that <single run> mode.

=head2 main

CHILD: this is the body of the child - all the other methods are intented
to setup the work to be done in this method.

Depending on which mode the Dragon is running in, the parameters will
differ, but a single Dragon will always recieve the same type of
parameters - meaning, all the childs of a given Dragon will always run
in the same mode, as the mode depends on the existence of the methods
L<data_consumer> and L<claim_task>.

Params:

=over 4

=item DC mode: $self, $id

The $id is the $id claimed by L<Data::Consumer> - your main method
should be able to handle getting the task from that id.

=item queue mode: $self, $task

the $task returned by L<claim_task>

=item single run more: $self

=back

=head2 task_done

CHILD[queue mode]: called when the child finishes processing a task and
the main method ended without errors. if the main method dies,
L<task_failed> will be called, instead of task_done.

task_done is only called in queue mode.

Params: $self, $task

=head2 task_failed

CHILD[queue mode]: called when the main method dies. 

Params: $self, $task

=head2 post_child_exit

MAIN[in the loop]: when a child ends, post_child_exit is called. This
allows you to clean up any data you may have in the main process
specifically for that child.

Params: $self, $child

=head2 pre_exit

MAIN: Called just before the process ends - allows you to run any clean
up you main want.

Params: $self

=head1 ADDITIONAL HOOKS

This two hooks are not related with the workflow of managing child
processes. However, this hooks are still running in the loop of managing
childs, so they should be as efficient as possible.

=head2 monitor

MAIN[in the loop]: monitor is called once a seconds in the main
process.

Params: $self

=head2 idle

MAIN[in the loop]: idle is called in the main process when no child
as ended, monitor didn't run and no child was created in that cycle.

Params: $self

=head1 COMMANDS

All the Dragons support several command line commands. You run a command
by calling your dragon followed by that command. Example:

<dragon.pl> start

=head2 start

Starts the Dragon as a dameon - it detachs from the current terminal,
create log files and socket file in /tmp. Before starting a new Dragon
it checks if there is a Dragon running and if it is responsive.

A normal thing to do, if you want your Dragons to never stop running
is to have a minutely cron starting then - if they are already running
nothing will happen.

=head2 startfg

Runs the dragon in the foreground, as a single process. Useful to test
and debug your process. It still calls all the relevant methods, except
for post_child_start and post_child_exit.

=head2 stop

Stops a Dragon started with L<start>. This uses the socket file to tell
the dragon to stop. The stopping process is graceful, which means that
this command tells the MAIN process of the running process that you want
it to stop, and it tells all their childs to stop when they are done with
their corrent task, which may take some time, depending on how long each
of you tasks takes to finish.

=head2 ping

Send a ping command to the MAIN process of a running. If there is a
Daemonized Dragon running, it will respond with pong.

=head2 info

Sends a info request to the MAIN process of a running Dragon and
gets some information about it's status - this will probably be
extended in the future.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

This variables are useful when running start or startfg. The control the
amount of information you will see from the Parallel::Dragons itself.

=head2 DRAGONS_DEBUG

Expected a values between 0 and 10. The relevant levels are:

=over 4

=item 0 - no debug.

=item 1 - some information

=item 3 - debug

=item 10 - trace

=back

=head2 DRAGONS_CRONJOB

Expected to be a true/false (1/0) value. It disables information about
other or not a Dragon was already or a new one was started.

Useful for cronjobs - may be replaced in the future with a check of a
TTY in STDIN/STDOUT

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are a lot of other perl packages to manage parallel execution
of code - depending on your use case some of them may be better than
Parallel::Dragons. This is just another option.
